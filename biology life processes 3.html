        </center>
        <p class="md" align="center">Earlier We Discussed That Plants Take in Raw Materials And Photosynthesise in Their Leaves to get energy. But not all of them are taken by the leaves.The other parts of the plant help in taking raw materials for building the plant bodies. For plants ,Soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen,phosphorus and other minerals.If The Distance between the leaves and the roots is small then transportation can be done by simple diffusion. As in plants it is a large distance so plants cannot transport by simple diffusion. So they have specified parts for the transport. As the Plants maximum contain dead cells and donot require much energy, transportation can be done at a slow rate. The transport systems also transfer food to other parts of the plants from leaves.</p>

        <p class="lg"><u>Transport Of Water</u></p><br>
        <p class="md" align="center">The Xylem tissues help the plant to transport the raw materials. The xylem of the roots,stems and leaves are interconnected to form continuos water conduction. In the roots cells in contact with the soil actively take up ions. The creates a difference in concentration. To eliminate this water moves into the cells. This means that there is a steady push of water upward from the root xylem. However this pressure is not enough for moving water to greater heights.</p>
        <img src="images/bio life processes/Transportation/Xylem.jpg" height="500" alt=""><br><br>
        <p class="md">As The Plants Has a abundant water supply, they lose a part of the water through the stomata which in turn creates a suction pull which pulls the water up from the root xylem. This loss of water from the stomata is known as transpiration.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p class="md">Thus, The transpirational pull in the day and the root pressure at the night play an important role in Transport Of Water and minerals in plants.</p>

        <p class="lg"><u>Transport Of Food And Other Substances</u></p><br>
        <p class="md">The Pholem Tissue Helps in Transporting the products of metabolic processes, particularly photosynthesis. This Tranports The products from leaves to other parts or the plants.This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis
            is called translocation and it occurs in Phloem Tissue. They also transport amino acids and other substances. These substances are
            especially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and
            to growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes
            place in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both
            in upward and downward directions.

            <p class="md">
            Unlike transport in xylem , the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising energy. Material like sucrose is transferred through phloem tissue using
            energy from ATP. This increases the osmotic pressure of the tissue
            causing water to move into it. This pressure moves the material in the
            phloem to tissues which have less pressure. This allows the phloem to
            move material according to the plantâ€™s needs. For example, in the spring,
            sugar stored in root or stem tissue would be transported to the buds
            which need energy to grow.

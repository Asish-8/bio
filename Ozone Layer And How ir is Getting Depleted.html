<p style="font-size: 4vw;font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif; margin-bottom: 3vw;text-align: center;">Ozone Layer And How it is Depleted</p>

<p class="aw">==>Ozone is molecule of oxygen (o3) formed by three atoms of oxygen. Where as O2 is oxygen gas which is neccessary for 
    survival of living organisms.
    <br>
    ==>Ozone is considered as a Venom. But at higher levels of atmosphere ozone plays a crucial role by acting as sheild 
    for the surface of earth from ultraviolet also known as UV radiation which are emitted by the sun .
    the UV waves when it reacts with human beings can lead to fatal conditions such as Skin cancer.
    <br>
    ==>It is due to the high Radiation Of UV From The Sun Three Molecules of Oxygen Gas In The Air Splits into atoms And Form Two Molecules Of Ozone Gas.
    <br>
    ==> The Equation is 3O<sub>2</sub> ==> 2O<sub>3</sub>
    <br>
    ==> The Decrease of Ozone is threat to organisms on earth. The ozone has been decreasing due to sythentic chemicals like
    CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) which are used in refregerants and in fire extinguishers. 
    <br>
    ==> But now it is mandatory for all maunfacturing companies to make CFC-free refrigerators throughout the world</p>
